<h1> Jade's Thoughts and Feelings </h1>
<p> Hello and welcome to my webpage. <br>
I'll be using this page to document my learning and understanding of website development as well as write my feelings and thoughts </p>
<h3> Saturday, June 13th </h3>
<p> I didnt sleep to well last night, woke up on multiple occasions from various things; </p> <ul> <li> cats meowing and moving <li> bad dreams <li> to warm or to cold </ul>
<p> went to bed early though and woke up early. Thats always a good start i suppose. Ran about a 2 mile run of sprints and rests, i felt amazing but was very red </p>
