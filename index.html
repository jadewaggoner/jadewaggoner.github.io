        <p>I've been working out more and been trying to learn more coding as well as balancing other things. Although i still find my self lying to my self about my true progress. I allow my self to think im more ahead than i am, making me quit faster.
        Brandon starts his summer semester of school soon, so im hoping that will make me want to spend some more time on doing my own schooling. Afterall, i am teaching my self. What am i waiting for? I continue to set goals for my self but make up 
            excuses for completion. I should start a schedule, at least for an overview day by day. So i can make sure im getting done what i need.
