        <p class="entry"> Ive been begining to better my self, both mentally and physically. Although it just doesnt feel like its enough, i feel like in my head im way more ahead than what i really am, i think im better than i really am. Im not, and i want some serious change. The only person whos responsible for it is my self. Brandon starts his summer school soon and ive barely touched my web coding class. If im really wanting to do this, i need to show my self im serious and get more into it and learn and practice more. Which is what im wanting to do with this website. Use it as a journal to help express my thoughts and feelings but also to practice what i learn with coding and ect...
