        <h1> The Witches Guide and Journey </h1>
        
        
        <p> Witchcraft is the practice of magical skills, spells, and abilities. The term is commonly associated with those who use metaphysical means to communicate with spirits, deities or ancestors. The most widely known characteristic of a witch is the ability to cast a spell, which could consisit of a set of words, a formula or verse, a ritual action, or any combination of these. Spells traditionally were cast by many methods, such as the inscription of runes or sigils on an object to give that object magical powers. <b> Wicca</b>, is a modern pagan religion.They share a general set of beliefs and practices. They believe in Goddess, respect nature, and hold both polytheistic and pantheistic views. </p>  <br>
           
            <br>
          <span class="definitions"> <p> An <b>Alter</b> is a surface that a witch uses solely for activities such as casting spells, chanting, and worshiping the gods and goddess. <br>

        <p class="test"><b>Deity</b>, or <b>Deities</b>, can protect you, help you, and teach you. You may ask a deity to help you with your spell, and their power will make it stronger. Some deities might "call" for you, they'll send signs that you'll see everywhere. A Patron Deity is your main Deity, the one you guides you and the one who will weave your path with you. </p> <br> 
        <br>
       
        
        <h2 class="subtitle"> Real Origins, Hunts, and Trials </h2>
       
        <p> Most early witches were thought to be pagans doing the Devil's work. Many, however, were simply natural healers or so-called "wise women" whose choice of profession was misunderstood. In the west, witchcraft has been more commonly believed to be an ordinary person's free choice to learn and practice magic with the help of the supernatural. In the earliest centuries of human civilization, witches were women who served goddesses and therefore were revered throughout their communities. Trained in the sacred arts and the holiest of rituals, they became known as <em> wise women </em> and may have some of the earliest manifestations of what we now recognize as the witch.<br> <br>
            The fear of witches spread to Europe. In the 1300s, when the plague decimated Europe and killed one in three people, it also brought with it hysteria. Many attributed their misfortune to the Devil himself- and his supposed worshipers. The Catholic Church's inquisition, expanded its efforts to seek out and punish the non-catholic causes of the mass deaths, including the Devil-doting witches. In order to save the church and its followers from the Devil, these women had to be 'tamed'. It is with that in mind the Catholic Church inquisitors Jacob Springer and Henrik Kramer wrote the <em> Malleus Maleficarum </em>, a book which assisted witch hunters in the gruesome task of diagnosing and punishing so-called witches.<br><br>
            The <em> Malleus </em> recommended not only torture but also deception in order to obtain confessions. All confessions acquired with the use of torture had to be confirmed, they'd be taken to another place and had to confirm to certify it was not due alone to force of the torture. The <em>Malleus Maleficarum </em> has been blamed for the death of tens of thousands of women and men, and its instructions on the identification, prosecution, and punishment of witches arguably did much to pave the way for the great witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe. The guide is divided into 3 parts, part 1 discusses beliefs about witches and their practices witches were thought to. It also discusses the Biblical and theological basis of witchcraft. Part 2 discusses in detail how witches cause harm and how that harm can be prevented. Part 3 is chiefly concerned with the legal aspects of trying and convicting witches. The authors justified their harsh tactics because it was believed necessary to vigorously persecute witches in order to protect the innocent from the Devil. </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle"> Altar Guide and Essentials </h2>
            
        <p> An <em>altar</em> is a "raised structure or place used for worship or prayer", upon which a wiccan practioner places several symbolic and functional items for the purpose of worshiping the God and Goddess, casting spells, and/or saying chants and prayers. There are many types of altars Wiccans may choose to use during ritual. Some say wood from an oak tree is best while others argue maple or teak are the only ones allowed. This is because in many circles, different types of wood are believed to carry certain magical qualities. For example, in one wiccan tradition, oak symbolizes great strength and may be used to strengthen the rite they are performing. In another tradition, maple may be seen as the strongest. Whether that be a coffee table or a tree stump, it is up to the Wiccan. <br>
            <br>
            Practitioners may keep various religious items upon the altar, or they may use the altar and the items during their religious workings. According to Scott Cunningham, a popular Wiccan author, the left side of the altar should be considered the Goddess area; feminine or 'yonic' (reproductive/feminine power)symbols such as bowls and chalices. The right side is designated for the God; 'phallic' symbols such as the athame and the wand are placed to the right side. The left and the right associateions vary according to personal preference, but the center area is almost always considered the "both" area, or the working area. In the center of the altar are kept the main symbols of the Wiccan faith, such as the pentacle. <br>
            <br>
            Some Wiccans arrange their altars to represent all four elements and directions. In the North the earth element is represented; in the east is air, in the south is fire, and in the west is water. These elements can be represented in various ways, but generally do not vary in elemental and directional correspondences. <br>

           <div class="altar"> Common items on a wiccan altar include: <br>
          <br>
               Candles<br>
               Incense<br>
               Wand<br>
               Pentacle<br>
               Offering bowls<br>

                </div> </p>
    
    
        <p> There are eight Wiccan holidays, known as sabbats, that celebrate the cycles and seasons of nature. These include the four seasons (Winter, Spring, Autumn and Summer), the mating habits animals and the reaping and sowing of crops. Based on the Sabbat, the altar is decorated accordingly. For example, the Summer Solstice altar cloth should be white and the altar decorated with summer flowers, fruits and anything else that symbolizes Summer. This goes for each Sabbat. Certain Wiccan traditions may have different colors but universally, the altar is usually decorated to represent the time of year.
