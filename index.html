        <h1>Green Roofing: <br>
   Everything You Need To Know</h1>
   
        <h3>WHAT IS GREEN ROOFING?</h3>
  
        <p>A green roof system is an addition made to 
   the roof of an existing building for growing plants 
   on the roof. Depending on the type of green roof you install, 
   the plants may be modular or have drainage layers. However, all green 
   roofs include a few important features, such as waterproofing 
   and root repellent, to keep the underlying structure safe and undamaged.</p>
       
        <h3>DIFFERENT TYPES OF GREEN ROOFING</h3>
       
        <p>here are two primary forms of green roofing: intensive and extensive.
            These are differentiated by the amount of vegetation utilized. While extensive green 
            roofs can support up to 25 pounds of vegetation per square foot,
            intensive green roofs can hold 150 pounds per square foot.
            Another factor that differentiates these styles is the amount of labor required 
            to maintain them. Intensive green roofs, as the name suggests, take a lot more work to
            manage, as they involve keeping the various types of plants separate and maintaining an 
            actual garden. Extensive green roofs, on the other hand, are left to grow naturally and 
            without restriction, taking care of themselves as they would in the wild, and thus only 
            requiring yearly weeding and fertilization.
            For homeowners, the intensive format allows you to pick and choose which plants 
            and flowers you would like to grow, enabling you to sculpt the aesthetic you desire. 
            Extensive green roofs are designed only to be entered for their yearly maintenance, so
            they become more naturally overgrown than their intensive counterpart. This makes extensive
            green roofs harder to navigate, meaning individuals can't walk through the space to enjoy the flora.
            Both green roofs use a layering system, which allows the use of various soils, mats, and 
            other materials to retain the nutrients while forcing out any waste by-products. Through these 
            layers, a natural soil profile is mimicked, thus creating a drainage process that allows liquid to 
            be filtered through safely while also nourishing the plants.
            There is a more recent hybrid form of green roofing, known as comprehensive roofing. 
            This format is made to support a wide variety of plants, which is commonly found in intensive
            roofing, while allowing for a greater amount of vegetation to be supported, like extensive roofing.</p>

        <h3>BENEFITS OF GREEN ROOFING</h3>
        
        <p>There are a variety of reasons why an individual would want to pursue green roofing, 
            both for the betterment of the community and the home.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
       
        <h4>COMMUNITY BENEFITS INCLUDE:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The installation of a green roof reduces the need to manage any stormwater 
                that accumulates, as well as the stress put on local sewer systems.
            <li>In urban settings, the inclusion of green roofs reduces the overall heat 
                conducted by the buildings, covering many of the surfaces that would generate the most warmth.
            <li>The plants prevent the distribution of smog and dust while also catching many of the 
                pollutants found in the air.
            <li>Green roofs can be public spaces, such as gardens or recreational areas, to be enjoyed by the community.
            <li>Due to the amount of work and money that goes into the creation and installation of green roofs, the use
                of them in a neighborhood can result in an increase of jobs and revenue for local businesses.
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>THERE ARE ALSO PERSONAL BENEFITS TO A HOMEOWNER,
            WHETHER YOU LIVE IN AN URBAN OR RURAL SETTING, FOR INSTALLING A GREEN ROOF, SUCH AS:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>By creating a natural barrier, green roofs can reduce the amount of noise that comes into your home.
            <li>Since your roof is covered by plants, the amount of it exposed to the elements is limited, 
                enabling the roof membrane to last much longer than if unprotected.
            <li>Green roofs reduce the amount of energy your house needs for heating, saving you money.
            <li>The fire retardation provided by green roofs helps protect your home.
            <li>Since green roofs utilize waste products that would otherwise end up in landfills,
                as well as extending the lifespan of your other household products like an HVAC system, 
                the use of one reduces the amount of waste generated by your home.
            <li>By adding a green roof to your house, you'll increase your property value 
                due to the enhanced efficiency of your appliances and your home becoming more aesthetically pleasing.
        </ul>
