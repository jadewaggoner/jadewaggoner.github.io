        <h4>Feb. 26th, 2020</h4>
        <p id="oops"> Today was a pretty good day, it was my first day starting to learn how to code and i feel like im picking it up pretty well and easily. Im also really enjoying it.
        Im having a bit of trouble remembering the basics of HTML with the deeper the lessons go into CSS but im sure ill get the hang of it with a little studying</p>
        <h4>Feb. 27th, 2020</h4>
        <p id="oops"> I didnt do as much as i did yesterday online but i had a productive day outside of it so i have a justitication for my self. I want to learn more and get good at the design portion of things, i just hope it doesnt get overwhelming. I need to take a break from going further and re read my notes and what ive learned thus far so i dont forget things.
