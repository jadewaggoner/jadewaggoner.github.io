   <h1>Green Roofing: <br>
   Everything You Need To Know</h1>
   
   <h3>What is Green Roofing>
   <p>A green roof system is an addition made to 
   the roof of an existing building for growing plants 
   on the roof. Depending on the type of green roof you install, 
   the plants may be modular or have drainage layers. However, all green 
   roofs include a few important features, such as waterproofing 
   and root repellent, to keep the underlying structure safe and undamaged.</p>
